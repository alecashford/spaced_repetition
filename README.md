#Mixologer
===

Are you studying to become a bartender? Or perhaps you're just a regular guy who prides himself as being an exemplary host who wants to easily and efficiently memorize the 200 most popular cocktail recipes. Either way, Mixologer is the Chrome extension you've been looking for. 

It is fundamentally a spaced repetition app, with an implementation of a variant of the SuperMemo2 algorithm to calculate the ideal time to review a cocktail recipe based on past performance and how well you rate your recollection of the card. Each day the icon on your browser will discretely remind you how many recipes are due to be reviewed for that day, and as it is a browser plugin, you can review in what is normally "dead time", for example, when web content is loading, or you are waiting for a download to finish.

All logic in the app itself is written in JavaScript, through the AngularJS framework.

Mixologer is currently undergoing a "soft launch" on the Google Chrome store. It can be downloaded for free here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ggfegmodenmjdnbpcglimkgpaihcmdfd/
